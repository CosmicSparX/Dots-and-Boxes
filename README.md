# Dots and Boxes

## Description
Dots and boxes is a classic pencil-and-paper game for two players. I've implemented it using python's tkinter library. I made this as my Python Project for Class 12th.

## Rules 
Players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots by a line. 
A player that completes the fourth side of a square (a box) colors that box and must play again. 
When all boxes have been colored, the game ends and the player who has colored more boxes wins.
